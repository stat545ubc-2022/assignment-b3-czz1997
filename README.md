# STAT 545B - Assignment 3

This is the repository for STAT 545B - Assignment 3 - Option A - BC Liquor app.

Visit the app at https://czz1997.shinyapps.io/bcl_new/.

### New Features

1. Allow users to decide the color of the bars in the plot.\
This feature could be useful if users want to collect plots under different filter and
want to distinguish them via different colors.

2. Sort data by price.\
Originally the data does not have any order, and providing the ability to sort data by price
can help discover the relationship between price and other variables and facilitate adjusting
the price range filter.

3. Separate plot and table tabs.\
Putting plot and table in different tabs can improve the UI to make the app
more visually pleasant and easy to use

4. Interactive table\
Interactive table provides searching, paging and sorting abilities for users
to further explore the results.
